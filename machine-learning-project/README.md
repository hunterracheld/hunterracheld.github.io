# Divorce Predictors Using Machine Learning

by Rachel Hunter, Rachel Trindle, and Michelle Trujillo

# Project Summary
The Divorce Predictors Data Set originally appeared in a 2019 study by YÃ¶ntem et. al. Researchers collected responses from 170 individuals through a "Personal Information Form" that incorporated a Divorce Predictors Scale developed by the researchers and based on Gottman Couples Therapy, a model that explains divorce based on empirical research. Our project asks the question, "Can machine learning be used to predict whether a couple is headed toward divorce?" What follows is an explanation of forecasting models used, visual exploration of the data, and a summary explaining our findings and identifying areas for further research.
