# Earthquake Visualization

This project makes a series of API calls to USGS's earthquake data and reads in the samples using d3, then plots the data on a world map with leaflet.js

I know it is not best practice to include a person API key or config file in a github repo, but I've chosen to include mine here in order to include this project in my portfolio.
